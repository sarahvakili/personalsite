			<p class="column">Hey, I’m Sarah.</p>

			<p class="column">I grew up just outside of Atlanta, Georgia, but I do not have a southern accent. I have a huge family – my dad’s side is Persian and my mom’s side is South Carolinian – and most of my life revolved around what we were going to have for dinner. I also have two younger sisters, and we had an amazing childhood that involved pre-iPhone era activities like riding bikes in the cul-de-sac, swimming in the neighborhood pool, and making huge craft messes.</p>

			<p class="column">After high school, I packed my bags and moved to the best college town in America to attend the University of Georgia (go dawgs!). I loved college. It was the best consecutive four years of my life. Besides making new friends and spending a little too much time tailgating before football games, I joined Alpha Chi Omega, served as an Orientation Leader the summer of 2010, and was a member of Dance Marathon all four years.</p>

			<p class="column">Post-graduation, I packed my bags once again and ventured to the Big Apple where I still live in the same East Village apartment because I refuse to pay a broker fee ever again. When I’m not working, I enjoy reading about real estate (StreetEasy is my homepage), keeping up with the NYC dining scene (go try the chicken sandwich at Cheeky’s), throwing rose-keg parties (yes, I said rose-keg!), and wishing I had a Bernedoodle named Bobby.</p>
